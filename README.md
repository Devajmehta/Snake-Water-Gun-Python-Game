# Snake-Water-Gun-Python-Game
A simple Python implementation of the classic Snake-Water-Gun game (a twist on Rock-Paper-Scissors) where the user plays against the computer.
# Snake-Water-Gun 🎮🐍💧🔫

This is a fun and interactive **command-line Python game** based on the traditional Snake-Water-Gun game — a variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## How to Play

- Snake (`s`) drinks Water → **Snake wins**
- Water (`w`) disables Gun → **Water wins**
- Gun (`g`) kills Snake → **Gun wins**

The player inputs their choice and the computer randomly selects its own. The result is displayed based on the defined rules.

## Rules Mapping

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `s`    | Snake   |
| `w`    | Water   |
| `g`    | Gun     |
